## 7.0 Introduction

## 7.1 The importance of quality evaluation for translation

Objects of evaluation :
- Student translations
- Professional translations

Formative and summative:
- formative : feedback while learning
- summative : for tests and exams

purposes?

Evaluation methods:
- rubric-style approach
- keystroke logging
- screen recording

Importance of Quality Evaluation :
- In educational context:
    - guide students through acquisition
    - help determine educational goal achievement
    - diagnostic tool for teachers
    - learning tool
- In professional context:
    - common framework for criticism and discussion
    - determine if product meets standards
    - helps make employment decisions
    - access translator competence
    - self-monitoring and peer feedback
    - contributes to development

## 7.2 Basic concepts of evaluation

Objects of evaluation : what to evaluate. e.g. products, process, competence, etc.

Purpose of evaluation : reason for evaluation. e.g. assess effectiveness, determine applicant competence, etc.

Summative vs. formative:
- Summative: overall evaluation (e.g. ATA accreditation exam, UN translation exam, NAATI accreditation exam) -> make judgement
- Formative: feedback for use in future -> improve future translation, learning and developing competence.

Criterion-referenced and norm-referenced evaluation:
- Criterion-referenced: examine based on previous criterion
- Norm-referenced: assess by comparing with a norm (average) -> subjective

## 7.3 Major approaches to evaluation

Procedural approaches evaluate:
- any problems in obtaining production and delivery information
- format specification
- communication with the customers, translators, revisers and editors,
-> Not necessarily the product quality, not covered.

Experience-based approaches: 
- error marking based on scales or systems (major and minor)
- certification exams by professional organizations and translation service providers -> assess competencies

Theoretical and research-based approaches:
- from theoretical or empirical frameworks, explicit models on translation nature
- abstract equivalence ideal as ultimate measure of quality
- inadequacies -> limit generalized application
- Specific types:
    - reader-response approaches: assess quality on response between source and target readers. problems:
        - reader response is difficult to measure
        - differences in same language readers.
        - not comprehensive (specific text not = others)
        - some aspects of brief may change
    - textual approaches: with respect to text type and function
        - analyze textual and situational features of source and target
        - basic measure: textual profile and function match
        - no more counting error, instead evaluating entire texts and goals of translations
        - not widely adopted

Common hurdle to research-based methods: 
- focus on partial aspects of quality, but assessments needs wide range of issues
- difficult to apply in professional and educational settings

## 7.4 Difficulties involved in evaluating translation quality

Lack of standardized methods of evaluation: stems from:
- multiple, unstated purposes of evaluation 
- multiple purposes of target text
e.g. for website - machine translation ok, not for constitution of a country

Approaches arise from models that focus on partial aspects: due to practical limitation and sheer complexity of the task

Practical concerns about implementation: hard for non-creator -> people in need create their own.

Difficulties in designing a system:
- Multiple views of translation.
- Multiple purposes of evaluation.
- The criteria used for evaluation are unclear or unstated.
- Many approaches are difficult to apply.
- Not comprehensive enough; focus on partial aspects of translation.
